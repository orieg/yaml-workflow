docs: comprehensive update to task definition and implementation

Major documentation improvements:

Task Definition Methods:
- Present both task registry and module/function as complementary approaches
- Remove legacy/deprecated language
- Add detailed examples and use cases for each method

Task Implementation:
- Add namespace management strategies
- Add version-specific implementation examples
- Document custom implementations of standard tasks
- Show how to handle task name conflicts

Best Practices:
- Add guidelines for choosing between approaches
- Add module organization recommendations
- Add naming conventions and namespace management
- Add documentation requirements
- Add error handling considerations

Examples:
- Add real-world examples for both methods
- Show advanced use cases like secure implementations
- Demonstrate version management
- Show namespace conflict resolution

The documentation now better reflects the power and flexibility
of having both task definition approaches available, particularly
for organization-specific implementations and namespace management.
